# datapipeline_project

The objective of this project is to build an end-to-end data pipeline that can handle event-based batch data and build a streaming pipeline.
1. Build an end-to-end data pipeline that can handle event-based batch data in cloud storage. 
2. Build a streaming data pipeline by leveraging Python to simulate from a dataset and publish them to Pub/Sub. Dataflow will process the streaming messages, do some transformations, and write the processed data to BigQuery.
